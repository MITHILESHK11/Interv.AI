# 💡 **Project Title:**  
> 🎙️ **AI-Powered Virtual Interview Simulator**  

---

## 🧠 **Project Overview**  

A virtual interview platform that simulates a real interview experience.  
The system will:  
✅ Generate dynamic interview questions based on topics, roles, and difficulty.  
✅ Ask questions using audio (Text-to-Speech).  
✅ Capture the user's spoken answers (Speech-to-Text).  
✅ Optionally evaluate the answers using AI.  
✅ Simulate different interview rounds (HR, Technical, Aptitude, Coding).  
✅ Provide feedback or performance score at the end.

## 🗂️ **Detailed Functional Breakdown**

---

### ✅ **1. Question Generation Module**
- Input:  
    - `Topic` (Java, Python, Data Structures, DBMS, OS, HR, Aptitude)
    - `Difficulty` (Easy, Medium, Hard)
    - `Round Type` (Technical, HR, Coding, Aptitude)
  
- Output: AI-generated interview questions.  
- Tool: `Google Gemini API` via Python.

Example Prompt for Gemini:
```
Generate 5 technical interview questions for the topic "Data Structures: Trees" at medium difficulty.
```

---

### ✅ **2. Question Text-to-Speech Module**
- Converts generated questions to spoken audio.
- Tools:
    - Google Text-to-Speech API (cloud, realistic voices).
    - `pyttsx3` for local development.

---

### ✅ **3. User Answer Listening Module**
- Uses microphone to record spoken answers.
- Converts audio to text using:
    - `SpeechRecognition` library (uses Google Web Speech API).
    - Or OpenAI's Whisper for higher accuracy.
  
---

### ✅ **4. Answer Evaluation Module (Optional)**
- Sends transcribed answer to Gemini for feedback:
    - Logic: Check if answer matches expected concepts.
    - Example prompt:
```
Evaluate the following answer for correctness and completeness:
"Answer: In object-oriented programming, encapsulation is the process of bundling data and methods..."
```
- Gemini returns feedback such as:
```
"Good explanation of encapsulation, but missed access modifiers."
```

---

### ✅ **5. Interview Report Generation**
- Generates a summary:
    - Number of questions.
    - Accuracy.
    - Speed.
    - Suggestions for improvement.
- Format: PDF / Web Display.
- Tools: `WeasyPrint`, `pdfkit`, or `ReportLab` for PDFs.

## 💡 **Architecture Overview**

```
User selects:
 ├──> Round Type
 ├──> Topic
 └──> Difficulty Level

-> Gemini generates questions.
-> Question is converted to Audio (TTS).
-> User answers via Microphone.
-> Audio is converted to Text (Speech-to-Text).
-> (Optional) Gemini evaluates the answer.
-> Score/Feedback updated.
-> Loop until questions finish.
-> Generate PDF Report.
```
